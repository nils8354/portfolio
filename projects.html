                        In this project we used our previous project of a crime database API and combined it with
                        nominatim and leaflet to make an interactive crime database map of St Paul. The user is able 
                        to interact with the map, by either inputting locations into the search bar, inputting longitude latitude
                        coordinates or zooming and panning over the map itself. While the user is interacting with the map a table 
                        with the data is populating below based on the view window of where the user is looking on the map. On this table 
                        the user can decide to add markers to the locations of these crimes and a clickable marker will appear on the map 
                        that will show the data of the crime and its location. Through this project I was able to gain a better understanding 
                        of how to deal with constantly updating variables on pages and more work with implementing other API's and frameworks.

                        This project was working with our classes UST-3400 Assembly language. Our
                        previous projects which were Single and Multi-cycle simulators were shown to be inefficient, so the point 
                        of this project was to create a Pipeline simulator that would be able to do 5 seperate steps, these included 
                        Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory and Writeback. While one stage was being used the pipeline could do another task
                        simultanesouly in a different part of the pipeline. This was to increase our throughput and performance drastically
                        for our simulator and to get an understanding of how a pipeline works.

                            For this project we had to visit a Christian church of a different culture.
                            Later in the semester we researched the differences between
                            American Christianity and our chosen culture we were studying, which in my case was of Korean Christianity.
                            I had to layout the problems that faced the Korean Church, and how they were tackling 
                            these issues.

                        When I was doing this project, it was the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                        Throughout most of my time at college we have been in the midst of this pandemic and 
                        it has been a stressful time. Through experiencing this and persevering I feel as if I have
                        developed into a better and more resilient person.  Learning through this pandemic was a challenge
                        and through this I had to be more creative in the way I learned and spending more time than I usually
                        would have to learn material. I think though that through these challenges I have became who I am today
                        and is why I can now apply what I have learned to my Capstone project, and also apply these skills
                        later to my job and later life experiences.
